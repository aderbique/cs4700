Dear grader, I have given an attempt at this assignment but was unable to successfully complete the task.
I have my functions written in expected.cpp and expected.hpp. The main function is supposed to include expected.cpp
but when I try, I receive many errors contained in compile_errors.png.

This assignment was extremely vauge and I hard to figure out exactly what Sundberg wanted for the assingment. 

Thought: I have been receiving errors with my struct. I tried removing it in expected1.hpp but that did not work
and only caused more errors. I do not know which direction to go from here.


Used for compiling on my machine is: g++ -std=c++1y main.cpp expected.cpp
